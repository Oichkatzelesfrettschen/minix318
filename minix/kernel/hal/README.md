# Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Design Principles for MINIX Kernel

## Purpose

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) in this MINIX kernel serves to isolate
architecture-dependent code from the generic, portable kernel components.
Its primary goals are:
- To provide a consistent interface for the kernel to interact with underlying hardware functionalities.
- To simplify porting the kernel to new hardware architectures.
- To encapsulate direct hardware manipulation, making the core kernel logic cleaner and more focused on OS policies.

## Core Design Philosophy

The HAL design is guided by the principles outlined in the "Comprehensive Mathematical and Technical Synthesis: MINIX Kernel Architecture Transformation" document, particularly Section 3.1 (HAL Abstraction Algebra).

The HAL will define an algebra `(H, {⊕, ⊗, ⊖})` where:
- `H` is the set of abstract hardware operations.
- `⊕` (oplus): Represents **Interrupt Composition** - operations for managing and chaining interrupt handlers, configuring interrupt controllers, and dispatching interrupts.
- `⊗` (otimes): Represents **Memory Mapping Composition** - operations for managing page tables, TLB entries, address space setup, and physical-to-virtual memory translations.
- `⊖` (ominus): Represents **Operation Inversion** - operations for cleaning up hardware state, releasing resources, or undoing setup operations (e.g., unmapping memory, disabling interrupts).

## Key Interface Areas (To Be Detailed)

This document will be expanded to include detailed interface definitions for:

*   **CPU Management:** Initialization, feature detection (interfacing with klib's `kcpu_detect_features`), context switching, SMP operations (if applicable).
*   **Memory Management Unit (MMU):** Page table manipulation, TLB flushing, address space switching. (Corresponds to `⊗`)
*   **Interrupt Handling:** IRQ registration/unregistration, enabling/disabling IRQs, interrupt dispatch. (Corresponds to `⊕` and `⊖`)
*   **Timers:** System clock, programmable interval timers.
*   **Console I/O:** Basic character output for debugging (e.g., `hal_console_puts`).
*   **System Control:** Reset, halt, power management hooks. (Corresponds to `⊖`)

Architecture-specific implementations of these interfaces will reside in `minix/kernel/arch/<architecture>/hal/`.

## Future Work
- Detailed API specification for each interface.
- Implementation for the target architecture(s).
- Formal modeling of HAL operations and their properties.
