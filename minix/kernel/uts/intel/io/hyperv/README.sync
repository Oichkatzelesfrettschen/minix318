	hyperv/hn: Enable multi-packet RNDIS message support by default.
	Differential Revision: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D8621

DEFER commit d01f31829b251bdc25f7394d7cf8986a91545dae

	Date: Mon Nov 28 05:31:36 2016 +0000
	hyperv/hn: Fix multi-packet RNDIS message aggregation size setting.
	Just in case that no chimney sending buffer can be used.
	Differential Revision: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D8619

DEFER commit 0b818a9bb24c271556d683bcb4ca90939c3f852c

	bit/packet rate tests and nginx performance test.
