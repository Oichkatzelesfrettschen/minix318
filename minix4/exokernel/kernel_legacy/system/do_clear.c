/**
 * @brief Clears and cleans up a process table slot when a process exits.
 *
 * This function handles the SYS_CLEAR kernel call, which is used exclusively
 * by the Process Manager (PM) to clean up process slots after process
 * termination. The cleanup process involves releasing various system resources
 * and resetting process table fields to their default values.
 *
 * @param caller Pointer to the calling process structure
 * @param m_ptr Pointer to the message containing the endpoint of the process to
 * clear (m_lsys_krn_sys_clear.endpt)
 *
 * @return OK on successful cleanup
 * @return EINVAL if the provided endpoint is invalid
 *
 * @details The cleanup process includes:
 * - Validating the endpoint and retrieving the process structure
 * - Releasing the process's address space
 * - Removing any registered IRQ handlers associated with the process
 * - Clearing the process's messaging capabilities
 * - Resetting kernel alarm timers
 * - Marking the process slot as free and unscheduled (RTS_SLOT_FREE)
 * - Releasing FPU resources and clearing FPU initialization flags
 * - For system processes, clearing the privilege structure
 *
 * @note This function only operates on processes that are not already cleared
 *       (checked via isemptyp()). Multiple calls on the same process are safe.
 *
 * @warning This function should only be called by the Process Manager (PM).
 *          Improper use by other processes could lead to system instability.
