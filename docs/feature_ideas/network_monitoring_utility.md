# Feature Idea: Basic Network Monitoring Utility

## Description

Create a new userspace utility, possibly named `netstat_minix` or a similar unique identifier (to be located in `minix/commands/` or `minix/usr.bin/`). This utility will provide basic network statistics and connection information, akin to `netstat` or `ss` on Linux systems.

Key functionalities would include:

*   Displaying listening TCP and UDP sockets.
*   Showing active network connections (TCP, UDP).
*   Providing statistics for network interfaces (e.g., packets sent/received, errors, etc.).

## Rationale

MINIX 3 includes networking capabilities, notably the Lightweight IP (LWIP) TCP/IP stack located in `minix/net/lwip/` and various network drivers found in `minix/drivers/net/`. A tool to inspect the current network state is a fundamental requirement for any networked operating system. Such a utility is crucial for:

*   Network troubleshooting and diagnostics.
*   Understanding network application behavior.
*   Security monitoring (e.g., identifying unexpected listening ports).

Currently, MINIX appears to lack a dedicated, user-friendly command-line tool for these purposes.

## Key Impacted Areas

*   **`minix/commands/` or `minix/usr.bin/`**: This will be the location for the source code of the new `netstat_minix` utility.
*   **`minix/net/`**: Modifications might be necessary to expose the required information from the network stack (e.g., LWIP, inet server) if it's not already accessible. This could involve changes to how connection tables, socket information, and interface statistics are stored or made available.
*   **`minix/include/net/` or `minix/include/minix/`**: New header files or updates to existing ones might be needed for any new definitions, data structures, or system call/ioctl interfaces required to retrieve network state information from the kernel or network services.
*   **`minix/usr.sbin/inet` (or other network services)**: The primary network server (`inet`) or other relevant services might need to be updated to implement the logic for gathering and providing the network statistics to the new utility.

## High-Level Steps (Conceptual)

1.  **Investigation:**
    *   Thoroughly examine how the LWIP stack (within `minix/net/lwip/`) and related network services (like `inet`) currently manage and store connection information (sockets, states, addresses, ports) and network interface statistics.
    *   Identify existing mechanisms, if any, that could be leveraged to export this data (e.g., existing system calls, ioctls, or internal data structures that could be exposed).

2.  **Interface Design (if necessary):**
    *   If a suitable interface for userspace retrieval doesn't exist, design one. Potential options include:
        *   New system call(s) specifically for network statistics.
        *   Procfs-like entries (if a procfs or similar virtual filesystem is planned or exists).
        *   New ioctl commands for existing character devices associated with the network stack (e.g., `/dev/ip`, `/dev/tcp`, `/dev/udp`).
    *   Define the data structures that will be used to pass information between the kernel/network services and the userspace utility.

3.  **Userspace Utility Implementation:**
    *   Develop the `netstat_minix` command-line tool.
    *   Implement logic to call the new/existing interfaces to retrieve data.
    *   Format and display the information in a clear, user-friendly manner (e.g., tables for connections, lists for listening sockets, summaries for interface stats).
    *   Include options for filtering output (e.g., show only TCP, show only listening sockets).

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Create a man page for the new `netstat_minix` utility, detailing its usage, options, and output format.

This utility would significantly enhance the observability and manageability of networking on MINIX.
