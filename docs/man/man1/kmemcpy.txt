KMEMCPY(3K)          Kernel Library Functions          KMEMCPY(3K)

NAME
     kmemcpy - copy memory area in kernel

SYNOPSIS
     #include <klib/include/kmemory.h>

     void *kmemcpy(void *dest, const void *src, k_size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
     The kmemcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to
     memory area dest. The memory areas must not overlap.
     Use kmemmove(3K) if the memory areas do overlap.
     This implementation typically uses __builtin_memcpy.

RETURN VALUES
     kmemcpy() returns a pointer to dest.
     Returns dest (even if NULL) if src or dest is NULL (specific to this klib impl).

NOTES
     This is a kernel-safe implementation. For overlapping regions,
     behavior is undefined.
