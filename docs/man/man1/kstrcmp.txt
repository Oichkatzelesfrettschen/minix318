KSTRCMP(3K)          Kernel Library Functions          KSTRCMP(3K)

NAME
     kstrcmp - compare two kernel strings

SYNOPSIS
     #include <klib/include/kstring.h>

     int kstrcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
     The kstrcmp() function lexicographically compares the null-terminated
     strings s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUES
     kstrcmp() returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
     according as the string s1 is greater than, equal to, or less
     than the string s2. Comparison is done using unsigned characters.
     Specific behavior for NULL pointers is defined in the implementation
     (e.g., NULL may be considered less than a non-NULL string).

NOTES
     This is a kernel-safe implementation.
