\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Structure representing a simple spinlock.

The spinlock\textquotesingle{}s state is determined by the {\ttfamily locked} member. It also includes basic statistics for acquisitions and contentions. It is crucial that operations on this structure use the provided {\ttfamily simple\+\_\+spin\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} functions to ensure atomicity and correct memory ordering.

The lock state. 0 for unlocked, 1 for locked.

{\ttfamily volatile} ensures that the compiler does not optimize away reads of this variable, as its value can change unexpectedly due to actions from other CPUs or threads. The atomicity of lock operations is guaranteed by GCC\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+sync\+\_\+\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} builtins, not by {\ttfamily volatile} itself.

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
